## 🎯 The Problem

Agriculture faces critical challenges in the digital age:

- **📊 Data Fragmentation**: Farmers track employees, harvests, and finances across spreadsheets, paper logs, and memory
- **💰 Financial Opacity**: Limited visibility into profitability per land plot, partial payments, and seasonal cash flow
- **👥 Workforce Management**: Complex payroll calculations, seasonal work tracking, and employee performance metrics
- **🗺️ Land Utilization**: Inefficient land usage without visual mapping and historical harvest analysis
- **📈 Growth Planning**: Lack of data-driven insights for expansion and optimization decisions

**Result**: Reduced profitability, operational inefficiencies, and missed growth opportunities.
